# Cyclistic-BikeShare-CaseStudy
How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
## Company Introduction

In 2016, Cyclistic successfully introduced a bike-sharing program that has since expanded to encompass a fleet of 5,824 bicycles, all equipped with geotracking capabilities and integrated into a network of 692 stations located throughout Chicago. This network allows users to unlock bikes from one station and return them to any other station within the system at their convenience.

Up until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy has centered on creating widespread awareness and appealing to a broad spectrum of consumers. The cornerstone of this approach has been the flexible array of pricing options, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who opt for single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as "casual riders," while those who invest in annual memberships become "Cyclistic members."

## Task Overview
Cyclistic's financial analysts have conducted an assessment indicating that annual members significantly outperform casual riders in terms of profitability. While the flexibility in pricing options has been successful in attracting a broader customer base, Moreno asserts that the key to future growth lies in maximizing the number of annual members. Instead of launching an entirely new marketing campaign to target potential customers, Moreno believes there is a substantial opportunity to convert existing casual riders into annual members. She highlights that casual riders are already familiar with the Cyclistic program and have actively chosen Cyclistic for their transportation needs.

Moreno, marketing analytics manager, has established a clear objective: Develop marketing strategies with the primary aim of transitioning casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, the marketing analyst team needs to gain a deeper understanding of:
1. The distinctions between annual members and casual riders.
2. Explore the motivations behind casual riders' potential adoption of annual memberships, and
3. Evaluate how digital media can impact their marketing tactics.
Moreno and her team are eager to analyze historical bike trip data from Cyclistic to discern relevant trends.

I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
